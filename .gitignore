# Large Data Files (too large for git without LFS)
# REMOVED from repo: BindingDB_All.tsv (6.2 GB), cpdb/ venv (1.1 GB)
# These are either integrated into results/ or reproducible via requirements.txt

# Exclude redundant/large files (keep only essentials):
results/edge_list.csv          # Redundant (for training, not needed in repo)
results/celltype_pair_weights.csv  # Redundant computation
results/course\ project\ example.pdf  # Example PDF, not needed
results/graph_with_random_features.pt  # Experimental, not needed
results/figures/iter*.png      # Keep only iteration 4 final figures
results/models/model_iter*.pt  # Keep only final models
results/integration_table.csv  # Old unweighted version
results/combined_dataset.h5ad  # Duplicate of dataset.h5ad, exclude from repo

# ALLOWING in repo (essential for submission):
# - results/graph.pt (preprocessed graph, needed for training)
# - results/integration_table_weighted.csv (affinity-integrated data)
# - dataset.h5ad (primary dataset)

# DO NOT EXCLUDE (keeping in repo):
# - results/models/*.pt (trained weights, small, needed for inference)
# - requirements.txt (pip install automatically creates venv)
# - results/figures/*.png (analysis plots)
# - results/graph.pt (preprocessed graph)
# - cellphonedb_data/ (reference data)
# - scripts/ (all utility scripts)
# - *.py (all training/analysis code)
